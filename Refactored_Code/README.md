# Code Refractor Assignment

## Description

In this project I had to take code created for a webpage for Horiseon Social Solution Services and refactor it.  That is, I had to take a look at the current code, and manipulate and edit it in a way to make it more concise and clear in it's viewing.  I needed to make sure that the code was free of any excess or redundant tags and to make it clearer to read for the next person who views it.  The revisions were made, not just to the HTML, but to the CSS as well.

I did this so that I might better understand what good coding looks like, as I will potentially have to do this for a client in the future.
