# Code Refractor Assignment

## Description

In this project I had to take code created for a webpage for Horiseon Social Solution Services and refactor it. That is, I had to take a look at the current code, and manipulate and edit it in a way to make it more concise and clear in it's viewing. I needed to make sure that the code was free of any excess or redundant tags and to make it clearer to read for the next person who views it. The revisions were made, not just to the HTML, but to the CSS as well.

I did this so that I might better understand what good coding looks like, as I will potentially have to do this for a client in the future.

How I did this was that I changed many of the html tags from highly specific tags to more appropriate semantic tags. I then changed the corresponding CSS elements to match up with the newly changed tags. I also combined certain CSS tags, as many of them had the same elements in them, despite having a different tag name. This allowed the CSS style sheet to be concise and easier to understand. I then made sure that the flow of the html and css documents was easier to assess.
I also added "alt" tags to the photos, that way ensuring something shows up, in the event that the image cannot render properly. I also made sure that the links at the top menu of the page directly connected with their corresponding articles at the bottom of the page.
